University Tasks
================

Tasks that were made during study in Donetsk National Technical University.


Diagnose system. Complete coincidence (diagnose-system-coincidence)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Diagnose system based on the principle of complete coincidence.

This project was made for Lab 1 on AI in the 5th semester.


Diagnose system. Confidence coefficient (diagnose-system-confidence)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Diagnose system based on the principle of confidence coefficient.

This project was made for Lab 2 on AI in the 5th semester.


MPI. Blocking and nonblocking exchange (mpi-exchange)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Distributed computing of task using MPI with blocking and nonblocking exchange. Sorts each input vector and sums them.

This project was made for Lab 2 on Parallel Computing in the 5th semester.

**Environment:**
* OS: *Xubuntu 13.04*.
* IDE: *Netbeans 7.4*.
* MPI library: *MPICH2*.
* Compiler: *wrapper of MPICH2 library (mpic++)*.


MPI. Collective operations of data exchange (mpi-collective)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Distributed computing of task using MPI with collective data exchange. Calculates the dot product of each row of the original matrix on the input vector and returns the minimum.

This project was made for Lab 3 on Parallel Computing in the 5th semester.

**Environment:**
* OS: *Xubuntu 13.04*.
